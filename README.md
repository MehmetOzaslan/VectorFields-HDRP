# VectorFields-~~~HDRP~~~ URP
This was my old calc 3 project but I am curious how far I should take this:

Some potential future features:

*Baked Mesh Vector Fields
*Octree generation and sampling for forces.
*Editor functionality

Of course this makes me wonder whether this is even worth doing, 
if you can bake something in Unity, you can probably bake it in Houdini.

Regardless, here are some photos of the functionality that was implemented.
